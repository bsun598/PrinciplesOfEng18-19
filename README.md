Problem 5:
The team must design a control system and a prototype of an elevator that can perform the following functions:
1. Move between three floors in any combination.
2. A set of three switches to represent each floor of the elevator. 
3. Each floor of the elevator must have a call button and a set of leds to indicate the position of the elevator. 
4. A built in safety mechanism requires that the elevator normally rest on the ground floor and return to the ground floor after a user determined period of time.
